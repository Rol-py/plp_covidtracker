# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description
This project is a Python-based tracker that fetches real-time global COVID-19 statistics. 
It analyzes the data using Pandas and visualizes key insights with Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
The tracker provides an overview of total cases, recoveries, deaths, active and critical cases, 
and can be extended to include historical trends and interactive dashboards.

## Objectives
- Fetch real-time COVID-19 global data from an API.
- Analyze key metrics such as recovery rate, death rate, and active cases.
- Visualize data through pie charts, bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots.
- Gain insights into global trends and the impact of the pandemic.

- Python 3.x
- Pandas (Data analysis)
- Matplotlib (Data visualization)
- Seaborn (Enhanced visualization)
- Requests (API data fetching)
